1. Make sure we have protoc installed
	brew install protoc-gen-grpc-web
	brew install protoc

2. Startup docker Server container - in tickServer Directory

3. Run buildJsClient.sh to build client.js - in tickWeb Directory

4. Run a webserver that would serve up client.js (via index.html) - in tickWeb Directory
	nginx

5. Build Envoy Proxy container - in tickWeb Directory
	buildEnvoyDocker.sh
	
6. Startup Envoy Proxy 
	docker run -d --name envoy -p 9901:9901 -p 9101:9101 envoy:v1

7. Point browser at localhost:8081


	8081 is served by Nginx Webserver that delivers client.js
	client.js connects to port 9001. Gets redirected by nginx to envoy proxy
	envoy proxy directs to tickServer on port 50081
